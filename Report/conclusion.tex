\section{Conclusion}

To sum up, in this paper we presented Yao's protocol and other MPC variants, together with some real-world examples of situations where these techniques are actually used. As discussed in section~\ref{sec:sel}, MPC could become more and more important in the future, but there must be careful considerations on its uses and the contexts where it is implemented, as to avoid its misuse and to safeguard users when it comes to the privacy of their data, both on an ethical and a legal perspective.
