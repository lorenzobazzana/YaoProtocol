\section{Outline}

This report presents a description on the security aspects of Yao's Garbled Circuit protocol~\cite{yao86}, together with a brief dissection on real world implementations of the protocol and MPC in general, and a reflection on the Social, Ethical and Legal aspects that are involved in the use of MPC.

Section~\ref{sec:yao} presents Yao's protocol and other Multi-Party Computation variants, while section~\ref{sec:rl} describes some of the real life uses of MPC techniques. Section~\ref{sec:sel} deals with the SEL aspects related to the use of MPC and its consequences on everyday life.
